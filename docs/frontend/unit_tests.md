# Unit Tests – Technical Documentation

## Stack

| Component         | Technology |

| Framework         | Vitest     |
| Browser Emulation | Playwright |

---

## Project Structure

Every component and service comes with a matching `[name].spec.ts` file, which contains its unit tests.

---

## Prerequisites

No running backend or frontend is required. Unit tests are fully self-contained:

- **Service tests** Use a mocked call to the backend to send and receive data.
- **Component tests** Check whether the component functions as expected, using a mocked Service.

---

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

To be able to run the tests, you need to run the following command from within the Angular project:

```powershell
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

To run all tests:

```powershell
# From the repository root:
cd ./Frontend/control-panel
npm test
```

To run a specific test file:

```powershell
# From the repository root:
cd ./Frontend/control-panel
ng test path-to-test/[name].spec.ts
```

## Design Decisions

### Using Vitest with Playwright

Due to Angular's native Vitest support and the known usage of Playwright for testing, Vitest with Playwright's browser emulation were chosen.

### Service Mocking

To avoid sending actual requests or running into connection errors, all services in these unit tests are mocked.

---

## CI / GitHub Actions

Unit tests run automatically on every pull request targeting `master` via the dedicated `.github/workflows/test-nodejs.yml` workflow. The workflow triggers after a successful Build Node.js CI run and executes:

```powershell
npm i @vitest/playwright-browser
npx install playwight --with-deps
npm test
```
